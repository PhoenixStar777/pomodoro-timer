Pomodoro Timer allows a person to work with Break and Work timed intervals.
Project involved an accessment of time intervals, such as, break time, focus time, whether the session was in session, paused, or had stopped.
There was also a progress bar that had to widen with the time when time was in session.
This was a good assignment for learning React States, destructuring, using mode, ternary conditions, and dealing with time.
